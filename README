WRF-Solar with BNL microphysics

  PUBLIC DOMAIN NOTICE
------------------------
This repository contains the WRF-solar with BNL microhysics schemes.
Two modules are available,

/wrfv4 - which contains the WRF-Solar based on WRFV4.1.2
/v41wps - which contains the WPS V4.1

The user may refer to the WRF User's Website or WRF User's Guide to
install and compile the code.

The BNL microphysics explicitly considers the following effects,
1) Dispersion effect of cloud droplet distribution on the effective
radii and autoconversion process
2) Turbulent and entrainment-mixing on cloud droplets

The BNL microphysics is built within the Thompson Aerosol aware (ThomA)
scheme. To use the BNL microphysics, the user should set the microphysics
scheme to ThomA in the namelist.input as
	mp_physics=28
To turn on BNL microphysics, one should set the following keywords in
the "&physics" section of namelist.input 
	dispers=2      --> enables the dispersion effect
	entrmix_opt=3  --> enables the entrainment-mixing parameterization
If 0 is provided in either keyword, the corresponding effect is turned off.
One may refer to the complete list of BNL MP keywords for the detailed
control of the processes which are described in the doc "BNL_mp_description".

        ! The following 3 parameters works only when "dispers" is non zero
	vdis                        = 0.3 ! constant value of relative dispersion used when dispers=1

entrmix_opt                         = 3    ! 0=no entrainment-mixing, 1=cumulus, 2=stratocumulus, 3=specified entrmix_a, 4=Xu et al 2021 fitting with on grid RH

	entrmix_a                   = 52   ! parameter a in the entrainment mixing parameterization
	entrRHd_c                   = 0.5  ! [0-1] representing the combination of two RHd calculations. When>1, use the RH on grid for sub-saturated grids instead.
	entrcf_opt                  = 2    ! cloud fractio parameterization used. 2=Xu-Randall 3-para formula
	RHd_ave_opt                 = 0    ! 0=no ave, 1=domain ave, 2=neighboring grids ave

One may refer to the Registry.EM_COMMON for more details about the
options of a keyword above. The corresponding process are described
