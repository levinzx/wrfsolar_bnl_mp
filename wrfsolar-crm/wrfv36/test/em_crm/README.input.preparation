Follow the steps to prepare the input fields:

1) Modify the large scale forcing in "input_ls_forcing.txt".
   Read "mk_input_ls_forcing.ncl" for the information about
   what each column represents.

2) Run "mk_input_ls_forcing.ncl" to create the input of the
   large scale forcing in NetCDF format.

3) Modify the surface forcing in "input_sfc_forcing.txt".
   Read "mk_input_sfc_forcing.ncl" for the information of
   the variables needed

4) Run "mk_input_sfc_forcing.ncl" to create the input of the
   surface forcing in NetCDF format.
